This site was inspired by the life of Amelia Earhart. “[The Flight of Freedom](TheFlightOfFreedom)”, written for the Chords of Courage STEP UP! Student Writing Contest, chronicles her life, from being told women can’t fly, through her last great adventure to fly around the world. Her daring and courage is an inspiration to all women today to rise above the messages of “You aren’t good enough” or “You can’t”.

> “[Chords of Courage](https://chordsofcourage.org) uses songwriting to shine a spotlight on the courageous among us, telling their compelling stories in an effort to transform the conversation from the demoralizing and cynical to the hopeful and inspirational one song at a time. These incredible stories inspire young and old alike to STEP UP! and make a difference in the world around us.”
