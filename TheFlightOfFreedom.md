Followed my heart, a woman aviator  
Learned from the start that I could be greater  
But they said remember your place  
Still deep inside I feel incased  
Flew across the Atlantic Ocean  
To see the world, to feel this motion  
People don’t agree  
But it's not a mystery to me

Cause there is freedom in our bones  
Waiting for us to claim as our own  
And when we’re lifted to the sky  
We can find the courage to fly

Felt the plane drop and with it my excitement,  
Suddenly lost filled with disappointment  
Could this really be the end  
Out here alone without a friend  
Don't want to admit they've proven me wrong  
And that I really wasn't that strong  
Still people they don't see  
That its not a mystery to me

Cause there is freedom in our bones  
Waiting for us to claim as our own  
And when we’re lifted to the sky  
We can find the courage to fly

And when I thought that all was lost  
I remember adventure is worth the cost  
And some day when I’m retired  
Other women can be inspired  
I lead the way for women like me  
And now they can truly be free  
People soon they’ll say  
That it can’t be a mystery today

Cause there is freedom in our bones  
We can claim it as our own  
And when we’re lifted to the sky  
We will find the courage to fly
